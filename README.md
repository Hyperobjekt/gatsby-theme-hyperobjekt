# Gatsby Theme Hyperobjekt

## Getting Started

This is a monorepo managed with lerna, install lerna using:

```
npm i -g lerna
```

## List of themes

TODO...

## Philosophy

_Less is more_

### Simple Core Theme

`gatsby-theme-hyperobjekt-core` was designed and built to be as simple and unstyled as possible. A barebones starting point which can be easily maintained in the future to manage dependencies on client sites.

### Child themes to extend the core theme

These child-themes are focused on extending function and remain as design-agnostic as possible. Again this makes longterm maintenance easier for client sites. It is my preference to begin new projects without too much styling that has to be undone.

### Starter sites to extend and style the themes

The starter sites provide a "quick start" for site development using the themes as dependencies. Currently the starter sites only provide basic implementation of the themes. It is my vision however that in time there could be more styled and complex starters released which do not need as much customization and include more rigid styling.
